  How to make elements within a container split into two rows:
  
  1) go to the element class in css
  2) adjust width => width: cal(100% / 3); => width: calc(each line has 3)
  3) adjust container display: flex =>  display: flex;
                                        flex-wrap: wrap; => multiple lines
