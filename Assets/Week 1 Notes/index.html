  Container and Row => Responsiveness Notes:

  How to make elements within a container split into two rows:
  
  1) go to the element class in css
  2) adjust width => width: cal(100% / 3); => width: calc(each line has 3)
  3) adjust container display: flex =>  display: flex;
                                        flex-wrap: wrap; => multiple lines
  
  div => container            will be used a lot
   and                    =>  container will be the parent
  div => row                  row will cap the sides from stretching

  Below code => content in <div class:"container"> will stay centered on the screen from a max width of 600 px

  .container {
  border: 4px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 24px 24px 0 24px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  }
  
  .row {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  }

Intro to CSS Notes:
  
  What is CSS?
   - Stands for Cascading Stylesheets
   - Used to style websites

  Methods for adding CSS
  There are three methods for adding CSS
  
  1) Inline CSS - style directly in the HTML element
  2) Internal CSS - using <style> tags within an HTML file
  3) External CSS (recomemended) - Linking an external CSS file
 
  Examples of CSS:
  - color = sets the color of the text
  - background-color = sets the background-color of the element
  - width = sets the width of the element, best practice is % instead of px
  - height = sets the height of the element
  - border = sets a border around the element 
  - font-size =
  - font-family =
  - font-weight =

  Importing Fonts:
   go to fonts.google.com
   find a font => get font
   click ' < > Get embed code'
   click ' change styles ' => selct font sizes
    ex: 
    Roboto => light 300, regular 400, medium 500, bold 700
    Select correct use: web and @import and follow directions

  Color in CSS:
  3 ways to get color

  - words: red, green, blue, cyan
  - RGB: rgb (0, 255, 0) => green
  - Hex: #ff0000 => red
  
  What is a box model?
    - a container that consists of multiple different properties
  What does it consist of?
      - content
      - padding (top, right, bottom, left) in px
      - border
      - margin (top, right, bottom, left) in px
  box-sizing 
    automatic => content-box; means content is the width and height that is set
                 border-box; border+padding+content => shrinks around content
  Vertical margins auto-collapse = best practice is to use margin vs padding
  Padding increases spaces within the box, Margin is for elements
  
  Complex Properties:
  - display: two css display values
    - block =>  takes 100% of the width and starts on a new line
                eg. <p> and <div> tags
    - inline => doesn't allow you to a set width or height for element and starts on the same line
                eg. <span> <img> tags
         
  Position: CSS position values (common)
  - static (default) => follows normal flow of the page
  - relative => follows normal flow of the page
             => lets you position using top, left, bottom, right
  - absolute => does not follow the normal flow of the page
             => lets you position with top, left, bottom, right
             => position is based off closest 'position': relative' parent
             => doesn't take 100% of the width - we would need to set it ourselves
  Position: CSS position value (uncommon)
  - fixed => sticks element to a permanent location on the page
          => lets you use top, left, bottom, right
  - sticky => sticks element to a permanent location on the page once it hits a threshold
  
  Media Queries:
  What are media queries used for? => used to make a web page responsive
  - Common Breakpoints (max-width)
    - 576px => mobile phones
    - 768px => tablets
    - 992px => desktops
    - 1200px+ => large desktops
  - syntax:

      @media (max-width:992px) {
        div {
          font-size: 20px;
        }
      }

      @media (max-width: 768px) {
        div {
          font-size: 18px;
        }
      }

      @media (max-width: 576px) {
        div {
          font-size: 16px;
        }
      }
  
  Extras (Pseudo selectors, Animations, BEM)
  Psuedo Selectors:
    We have 2 pseudo elements in CSS
     - after
     - before

    Pseudo elements = accessed by two colons:

      div::before {
      content: "Frontend Simplified"
      }
    
      index.html has a <div>Welcome to</div>
      using the below css => Welcome to Frontend Simplified
      and the opposite div::after => Frontend Simplified Welcome to
      
        div::before{
        content: "Frontend Simplified"
        }
      }

    Psudo class = accessed by one colon:

      div {
      transition: background-color 300ms;
      }
      
      div:hover {
      background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
      }

      Used to trigger dark mode and light mode by changing background contrast or color
    
    Making a button float css syntax:

      button {
      animation: float 2000ms infinite;
      transition: all 300ms;
      }
      
      button:hover {
      background-color: black;
      color: white;
      }
      
      @keyframes float {
      0% {
      transform: translateY(0);
      }
      100% {
      transform: translateY(10px);
      }

      The button is floating but hard resets back to the starting position
      By changing the button from:

        button {
        animation: float 2000ms infinite;
        transition: all 300ms;
        }

        to

        button {
        animation: float 2000ms infinite alternate-reverse;
        transition: all 300ms;
        }
        
      The floating button now slowly comes down and slowly reverses up

  BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) is a naming convention used for CSS classes to make them easier to read and understand
    
    Block Element Modifier
     - B [block] is the block component => <button> <nav> <main> <footer>
     - E [element] is the dependent on the block component
     - M [modifier] is used to change the style of the block

      index.html:

      <nav class="nav"></nav>
      <a href="" class="nav__link nav__link--active">Home</a>
      <a href="" class="nav__link">About</a>
      <a href="" class="nav__link">Pricing</a>
      <a href="" class="nav__link">Contact</a>

      style.css:

      .nav__link {
      color: black;
      }
      .nav__link--active{
      color: purple;
      font-weight: bold;
      }

  Flexbox Notes:

  display: flex;
  justify-content: ___; => aligns items horizontally with the following ___:
  
    - flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
    - flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
    - center: Items align at the center of the container.
    - space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
    - space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.

  display:flex;
  align-items: ___; => aligns items vertically with the following ____:
  
    - flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
    - flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
    - center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
    - baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
    - stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

    - Another property you can apply to individual items is align-self. This property accepts the same values as align-items and its value for the specific item.

  display:flex;
  flex-direction: ___; 
    => defines the direction items are placed in the container, with the following ____:
  
    - row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
    - row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
    - column: Items are placed top to bottom.
    - column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.
  
  Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. In these cases, we can apply the order property to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2). 

  .___ {
  order: ___;
  }

  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: ___; => Spreads elements out, using following __:
  
    - nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
    - wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
    - wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.

  display: flex;
  flex-flow: __ __; 
  => combines both properties of flex-wrap and flex-direction seperating the __ with a space
    - i.e. 
      1) flex-flow: row wrap; => items are placed in a row to additional lines
      2) flex-flow: column wrap-reverse; items are in a column and opposite order
  
  display: flex;
  align-content: ___; 
  => sets how multiple lines are items are spaced apart from each other, using following ___
  
    - flex-start: Lines are packed at the top of the container.
    - flex-end: Lines are packed at the bottom of the container.
    - center: Lines are packed at the vertical center of the container.
    - space-between: Lines display with equal spacing between them.
    - space-around: Lines display with equal spacing around them.
    - stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.

    align-content => determines the spacing between lines
    
    align-items => determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container
    
    - When there is only one line, align-content has no effect
