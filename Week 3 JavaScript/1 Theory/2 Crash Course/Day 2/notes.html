JavaScript Crash Course:
  Data types and variables
  Conditionals
  Loops
  Functions
  Arrays
  Objects
  DOM

Console:
  typeof__ => gives the data type
  !!__ => logs if value is truthy or falsy

Data types and variables
  What are data types in JavaScript? => data types help us organize data

  Examples of data types
    String => text
    Number => number
    Boolean => true or false
    Undefined => nothing
    Null => nothing

    String => inside quotation marks 
      ex => "Hello World" 'Frontend Simplified is amazing' `100`

      Index Numbers:
      D A V I D =>  0 1 2 3 4

      Log the length of the String:
      ex => console.log('12345'.length)

      Last index of the string:
      ex => let str = 'David'
            console.log(str[str.length - 1])

    Number =>
      ex => 2, 10.5, -5

      Symbols => respects math's order of operation
      + => addition
      - => subtraction
      * => multiplication
      / => division
      % => modulo - calculates the remainder

      Boolean => true or false
        ex=> 5 < 10 -> true

      Null and Undefined
        Null => value of nothing
        Undefined => value was never set

      NaN => not a number, means there's an error
    
  Variables => store data

    How to define a variables
      var => outdated
      let => reassignable
      const => not reassignable

    Variable names are in camelcase => name fullName lastName

    Equality => "==" and "==="

      = => sets a value
      == => checks the values -> returns true or false
      === => checks the values and the types -> best practice

    Not Equal To => adding a '!'
    
      != => checks if the values are equal to eachother
      !== -> best practice
      !false => prints the opposite value -> true

Conditionals => if, else 
  Example:

    let subscribed = true              
    let loggedIn = true                     

    if (subsribed === true) {          => will print if the user is subscribed
      console.log('show the video')       
    }
    else if (loggedIn === true) {          => will print if user is logged in but not
      console.log('tell user to upgrade')     subscribed
    }
    else {                                           => will print if user isn't
      console.log('tell user to log into account')      logged in or subscribed
    }

  Example => replacing print with a variable in the string, using JavaScript

    let cash = 30
    let price = 40

    if (cash > price) {
      console.log(`you paid extra - here's" ${5} "dollars change`) => using backticks 
    }                                                                 we can use js
    else if (cash === price) {                                        in the string
      console.log("you paid the exact amount, have a nice day!")      ex: ${5}
    }
    else {
      console.log("not enough money - you still owe x dollars")
    }

  Comparison Operators => comparing two values with eachother
    
    == => equal values
    === => equal values and types
    != => not equal
    !== => not equal value and equal type
    > => greater than
    < => less than
    >= => greater than or equal to
    <= => less than or equal to

  Logical Operators:

    '&&' => checks if the left and right side of the comparison is true
      ex: true && true => true
          true && false => false
          false && true => false
          false && false => false

    Example =>

    let cash = 50
    let price = 40
    let isStoreOpen = true

    if (cash >= price && isStoreOpen === true) {   => if cash is greater or equal to
      console.log('print the reciept')                price AND store is open, print
    }

    '||' => checks if the left or right side of the comparison is true
      ex: true || true => true
          true || false => true
          false || true => true
          false || false => true

    Example =>

    Example =>
    
    let cash = 50
    let price = 40
    let isStoreOpen = true
    
    if (cash >= price || isStoreOpen === true) {  => if cash is greater or equal to
    console.log('print the reciept')                 price OR store is open, print
    }

Falsy Values
  => values that are considered 'false' when converted to a boolean
    
    Undefined
    Null
    NaN
    0
    ""
    false

Truthy Values
  => values that are considered 'true' when converted to a boolean

  10
  3.14
  "Frontend Simplified"
  "false"
  "0"
  []
  {}

Ternary Operators => shortcut for an else condition

  isObese ? 'unhealthy' : 'healthy' 
  => if the value of isObese true print unhealthy, else print healthy

  subscribed ? 'show video' : 'hide video'
  => if suscribed print show video, else print hide video

  Example:

  let subscribed = false
  let loggedIn = true
  
  subscribed ? 'show video' : 'hide video' => see above, line 182
