  Loops:
  What are loops used for? => repeat the same code over and over again

  What are the types of loops in JavaScript?

    for loop
    while loop
    do while loop

    For Loop:
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }

      let i = 0; => sets 'i' to 0
      i < 100; => 'i' less than how many times we want to loop
      i++ => increment 'i' by 1
