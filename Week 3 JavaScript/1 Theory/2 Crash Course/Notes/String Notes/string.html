Functions
Arrays

DOM


Data Types => helps us organize date

Examples of Data Types =>

  1) String => text data
  2) Number => number data
  3) Boolean => true or false statements ie login
  4) Undefined
  5) Null

  String => basically text in one long String
    => app.js:  console.log('Hello world') => text string
                console.log('Hello world' + 'djfbasjb') => combining two strings

    examples => "Hello World"
                "Frontend Simplified is amazing"
                "100"

      D A V I D => index numbers
      0 1 2 3 4

  Number =>
  ex: 2
      10.5
      -5

      typeof ___ => logs the data typeof

      + => addition           respects math order of operations
      - => subtraction
      / => division
      * => multiplication
      % => modulo
      
        Modulo => example:  15 % 5
                            0       => will console log 0 because 15 is divisible by 5

                            16 % 5
                            1       => will console log 1 because the remainder is 1

                            "how any time is 16 divisible by 5" => log remainder

  Boolean => True or False

  example:  5 < 10
            true

            5 > 10
            false

  Null and Undefined
    Null => value is nothing
    Undefined => value was never set

    NaN => Not a number
      'david'/5
      NaN

      Math.sqrt(-50)
      NaN

  Variables:
    What are variables used for? => store data

    FS: Account Details 

    Email => string holding email variable 
    Name => string holding name variable
    Password =>
    Subscription Plan =>
    Billing Info =>

    How do you define a variable?

    var => old syntax
    let => 
    const =>

  Converting Temperatures
  Celsius-to-Farenheit formula =>
  
    F = C x 1.8 + 32
  
    let celsius = 10;
    let farenheit =
    <!-- => converts celcius into fahrenheit -->
  
    console.log()
    <!-- print out result -->
    
  Equality
  
  "= =" and "= = =" => == and ===
  
  == => checks the values
  === => checks the values and the types
  
  See notes.js
  
    Not Equal: " ! = = " => !==
  
    let bool = '1' !== 1
    
    console.log(bool)
    => will console log 'true' because youre asking if '1' is not 1
  
    let bool = !true
    => will console log 'false' because it is the opposite of 'true'
