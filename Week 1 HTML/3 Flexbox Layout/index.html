  Default Layout:
  display:block; => elements stacked on top of eachother, line after line

  Scenario #1
  display:flex; => elements are side by side

    display:flex; unlocks:
      - flex-direction
      - align-items
      - justify-content

  Magical Property #1: flex-direction
  Scenario #1.1 => using flex-direction: row;

    display:flex;
    flex-direction: row; (default)
      - by default elements will align side by side

  Scenario #1.2 => using flex-direction: column;

    display:flex;
    flex-direction: column;
      - elements will stack on top of eachother
      - exactly the same as using => display:block;
  
  Magical Propetty #2: align-items
  Layout #2 => using align-items

    display: flex;
    align-items: stretch; (default)
      - elements are stretched to the top and bottom of the container

  Scenario #2.1 => using align-items

    display: flex;
    align-items:center;
      - most used, aligns elements vertically

  Scenario #2.2

    display:flex;
    align-items: flex-end;
      - aligns elements to the bottom of the container
  
  Magical Property #3: justify-content
  Layout #3 => using justify-content

    display:flex;
    justify-content: flex-start; (default)
      - aligns elements horizontally at the start of the element
    
  Scenario #3.1 => using justify-content

    display:flex;
    justify-content: center;
      - puts all the elements at the center of the container

  Scenario #3.2 => using justify-content

    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-end;
     - puts all the elements at the end of the container, at the horizontal

  Scenario #3.3 => using justify-content

    display:flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
     - makes sure the spaces around and in between each element is the same

  Scenario #3.4 => using justify-content

    display:flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
     - moves element #1 all the way to the left and element #3 all the way to the right an equalizes the spaces between all three elements
     - used on <nav> a lot

  2 Wizards Together
    
    justify-content: ____; and align-items: _____;

  Scenario #4.1 => using justify-content and align-items

    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
     - aligns elements both in the center vertically and horizontally

  Scenario #4.2 => using justify-content and align-items

    display:flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
     - aligns element #1 to the far left, element #3 to the far right, centered at the vertical axis

  3 Wizards Together

    justify-content: ___; and align-items: ___; and flex-direction: ___;

  If we use:
    
    flex-direction: column; => justify-content: ___; and align-items: ___; switch roles
     - align-items: ___; changes to horizontally
     - justify-content: ___; changes to vertically

  Scenario #5.1

    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
     - aligns element to the top of of the vertical axis and center on the horizontal axis

    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
     - aligns element to the center of both the vertical and horizontal axis

  AT THE START OF EVERY PROJECT DAVID SETS EVERY ELEMENT IN STYLE.CSS TO => border-box

    *{
      box-sizing: border-box
    }

<!--

  justify-content: flex-end; => elements move to far right on the horizontal axix

  justify-content: center; => elements align at the center of container on the horizontal axis

  justify-content: space-around; => elements have equal space around themselves on the horizontal axis

  justify-content: space-between; => elements have equal space between themselves on the horizontal axis

-->

<!--

  display: flex;
  justify-content: ___; => aligns items horizontally with the following ___:
  
    - flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
    - flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
    - center: Items align at the center of the container.
    - space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
    - space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.

  display:flex;
  align-items: ___; => aligns items vertically with the following ____:
  
    - flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
    - flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
    - center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
    - baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
    - stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

    - Another property you can apply to individual items is align-self. This property accepts the same values as align-items and its value for the specific item.

  display:flex;
  flex-direction: ___; 
    => defines the direction items are placed in the container, with the following ____:
  
    - row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
    - row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
    - column: Items are placed top to bottom.
    - column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.
  
  Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. In these cases, we can apply the order property to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2). 

  .___ {
  order: ___;
  }

  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: ___; => Spreads elements out, using following __:
  
    - nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
    - wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
    - wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.

  display: flex;
  flex-flow: __ __; 
  => combines both properties of flex-wrap and flex-direction seperating the __ with a space
    - i.e. 
      1) flex-flow: row wrap; => items are placed in a row to additional lines
      2) flex-flow: column wrap-reverse; items are in a column and opposite order
  
  display: flex;
  align-content: ___; 
  => sets how multiple lines are items are spaced apart from each other, using following ___
  
    - flex-start: Lines are packed at the top of the container.
    - flex-end: Lines are packed at the bottom of the container.
    - center: Lines are packed at the vertical center of the container.
    - space-between: Lines display with equal spacing between them.
    - space-around: Lines display with equal spacing around them.
    - stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.

    align-content => determines the spacing between lines
    
    align-items => determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container
    
    - When there is only one line, align-content has no effect
